Rollout is a Secure Feature Managment Solution for the Enterprise.

> Accelerate development and minimize the risk of deploying new code with simple to create feature flags, controlled rollouts, advanced target groups & deployment rules.

## Getting Started

Please see the detailed instructions in our docs how to [add Rollout to your project](https://support.rollout.io/docs/installing-the-sdk).

## Requirements

PHP 7.3 or later.

The following extensions should be enabled in php.ini:

* openssl

**Warning**: If you use `5.0.2` version of `rox-php`, and you are planning to migrate to `5.0.3` or later, you must clear the cache on your deployment environments, as it may cause runtime issues (check [this discussion](https://github.com/Kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware/issues/172) for more details).
